# ⚡ Automatic Power Factor Correction (APFC) – Proteus Simulation

## 📌 Project Title
**Automatic Power Factor Correction (APFC) using Arduino and Relay-Based Capacitor Switching**

---

## 📝 Short Description
This project demonstrates an **Automatic Power Factor Correction (APFC)** system simulated in **Proteus** using an **Arduino UNO**.  
The system continuously monitors the power factor (simulation-level approximation) and automatically switches capacitor banks through relays to improve the overall power factor.  
The focus of this project is on **control logic, automation, and system behavior**, making it suitable for academic demonstration and learning purposes.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Proteus 8 Professional** – Circuit design and simulation  
- **Arduino UNO** – Control and decision-making unit  
- **Arduino IDE** – Code development and HEX generation  
- **C / C++ (Arduino)** – Control logic programming  
- **20×4 LCD** – Display of power factor and capacitor status

## ⚙ How It Works (Simple Explanation)
1. The system receives a phase-difference or power-factor–related signal (simulated).
2. The **Arduino UNO** processes this signal and determines whether the power factor is low.
3. Based on predefined thresholds, the Arduino **switches relay-controlled capacitor banks ON or OFF**.
4. Adding capacitors compensates reactive power and improves the power factor.
5. The **The LCD displays voltage, current, power factor, power quantities, and the status of the capacitor banks.**.
6. The entire behavior is verified through **Proteus simulation**.
